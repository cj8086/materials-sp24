Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, and projects submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit. Projects submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.**  For full credit on the checkpoint, you must complete the questions up to the checkpoint, **pass all _public_ autograder tests** for those sections, and submit to the Gradescope Project 1 Checkpoint assignment by **5:00pm PT on Friday, 2/16**. <span style=\"color: #BC412B\">**The checkpoint is worth 5% of your entire project grade**</span>. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your project answers before the final project deadline - only your final submission, to the \"Project 1\" assignment, will be graded for correctness. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",

On Gradescope, the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.** Once you submit, click into your submission, and there will be an option to Add Group Member in the top right corner. You may also reference [this walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POtij6KECSBjCUeOC_F0Lt3ZmKN7LKIq/view?usp=sharing) on how to add partners on Gradescope.\n",

To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect.
