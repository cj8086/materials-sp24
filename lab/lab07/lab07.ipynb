    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation does not imply causation**: Just because winners tend to have won more Star Baker awards does not mean that winning these awards causes contestants to win the season. It's possible that both are effects of underlying factors such as skill level, creativity, or experience in baking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selection Bias**: Contestants who win Star Baker awards might be inherently more skilled or talented at baking compared to those who do not win any awards. Thus, their higher skill level, rather than the act of winning the award itself, could be what increases their odds of winning the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confounding Variables**: There may be other variables that affect both the likelihood of winning Star Baker awards and the ultimate outcome of winning the season. For example, a contestant's ability to perform under pressure, their versatility with different types of bakes, or even their personal story and how it resonates with judges and viewers might influence both outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reverse Causality**: While it's hypothesized that winning Star Baker awards affects the odds of winning the season, it could also be that contestants who are already likely to win the season due to their superior skills and consistency are more likely to win Star Baker awards throughout the competition. This makes it a challenge to determine the direction of causality."
